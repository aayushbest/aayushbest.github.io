                    The history of Butter Chicken aka Murgh Makhani in Hindi,
                    starts post partition of India in 1947. A guy named <b>Kundan Lal Gujral</b>
                    who was working in a dhaba called Mokhe Da Dhaba in Lahore before Partition moved 
                    to Dehli post partition and setup its outlet called Moti Mahal where he used to sell
                    Tandoori Chicken(that's a story of some other day) but one of the challanges he faced
                    that tandoori chicken which are not sold till evening gets dried and is of no use.
                    He found a way he made a tomato and cream base gravy with assorted aromatic indian spicies
                    and tossed the dried tandoori chicken in that
                    and that's how <em>Butter Chicken was born.</em>
